## Section 1(7) - How to get the most out of this course
- Don't code along. Instead, watch the video and then reflect on your understanding of the content. Query why a code is written and preempt the result you expect to see. 
- Take notes after those 10 minutes of watch for understanding. These notes will become valuable to you in your journey.
- Then get on your code editor and try to replicate what you have just watched, without looking at the code from the video. Iterate if necessary.
- Review your notes and pick out questions and keywords that you want to research on later. You can also include memory hints for yourself. 
- Change the playback speed to fit your requirements.
- Try not to skip any lessons. You can playback at a higher speed if you find some content too easy.
- Rewatch videos that you find difficult. If you still don't understand some aspects after rewatching, bookmark it and take some time to research around the topic. If you come back to the same video after a couple of days of researching, it will become much easier to understand.
- Practice and perseverance leads to mastery.
> Embrace situations where you struggle or get stuck. Use tools like Google and stackoverflow to get unstuck. Enjoy that feeling that comes when you finally solve a problem. `Consistent practice leads to mastery!`

Will you quit when you get stuck? Remember that good programmers just stare at the screen more than half of the time! You will be hired to solve problems, so get used to the stuck-unstuck cycle. Enjoy it!
